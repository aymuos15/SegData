  "description": "2D bone tumor X-ray radiograph dataset with binary segmentation masks. 1,867 annotated tumor images (1,525 benign + 342 malignant) from a multi-institution study. Normal radiographs are excluded as they have no segmentation annotations. 80/20 train/test split applied algorithmically by sorted filename.",
